## Iteration 35 - Transcript Synchronization Fix

### Problem
Stage 1 (Spartan) verification was failing in strict sumcheck mode. The prover and verifier transcripts were out of sync, causing different challenges to be generated.

### Root Cause
1. `verifyR1CSProof` was generating a spurious "r1cs_tau" challenge before the multi-stage verification began
2. Stage verifiers were using `num_rounds` (number of round polynomials) instead of `log_t` for cycle challenges

### Solution
1. Removed the spurious challenge from verifyR1CSProof
2. Added log_t and log_k fields to JoltStageProofs
3. Updated all stage verifiers to use correct challenge counts
4. Added computeInitialClaim() to Lasso prover

### Result
Stage 1 (Spartan) now verifies correctly with strict sumcheck enabled! All 11 rounds pass the p(0) + p(1) = claim check.

Stages 2-6 still require lenient mode due to claim tracking issues in the Lasso prover that need further investigation.

## Iteration 3 Summary

### Completed Tasks

1. **Proof Converter** ()
   - Created ProofConverter to map Zolt's 6-stage proofs to Jolt's 7-stage format
   - Stage mapping: 0→1, 1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, 5→6, create→7
   - Creates UniSkipFirstRoundProof for stages 1-2
   - Populates OpeningClaims with SumcheckId mappings
   - Configuration parameters: bytecode_K, log_k_chunk, etc.

2. **JoltProver Integration** ()
   - Added `proveJoltCompatible()` method to generate Jolt-format proofs
   - Added `serializeJoltProof()` method for arkworks-format serialization
   - Wires up proof converter with prover

3. **End-to-End Serialization Tests** ()
   - Added comprehensive test for JoltProof with all 7 stages
   - Added test for empty JoltProof serialization
   - Verified opening claims, commitments, and UniSkip proofs serialize correctly

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated TODO.md with complete status
   - Added cross-verification notes explaining Dory requirement
   - Updated NOTES.md with implementation summary

### Test Status
- All 578 tests pass
- Build succeeds

### Commits Made
1. feat: add proof converter for Zolt→Jolt 6-stage to 7-stage mapping
2. feat: add Jolt-compatible proof export to JoltProver
3. test: add end-to-end JoltProof serialization tests
4. docs: update TODO with complete Jolt compatibility status
5. docs: document complete Jolt compatibility implementation in NOTES

### Remaining Work
- Dory commitment alignment (Zolt uses HyperKZG)
- Jolt-side cross-verification test
