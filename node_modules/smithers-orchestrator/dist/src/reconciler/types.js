/**
 * Core type definitions for Smithers reconciler.
 * These types define the SmithersNode tree structure that the reconciler creates.
 *
 * Key architectural principle: Components execute themselves via useMount,
 * not via external orchestrators. State changes (via React state) trigger
 * re-renders, which trigger re-execution. This is the "Ralph Wiggum loop"
 * pattern - change the key prop to force unmount/remount.
